		<h1><em><u> Mission Statement </u></em></h1>
	<blockquote>
		
			<hr>
		<strong>

			The website I am proposing to build is a representation of what I hope to be my business in the future. Technology is always going to be around and in the coming years it will continue to be a part of our daily lives more and more. For this reason, I plan on starting a tech security firm. Most tech consumers have private information on their devices that they would never want to fall into the wrong hands, and for that reason they will want the best of the best when it comes to how their devices are secured. I plan on being a big part of that. Privacy is very important to me, and many others, and rightfully so. Consumer device security should be easy to find, implement, and constantly improving on a day-to-day basis, because that is what todayâ€™s hackers are doing.

		<!--Model Sites-->

			<h2><em><u> Influential Websites</u></em></h2>
		<hr>
		There are two websites I have modeled mine after and the first, is one that my father introduced to me, FRSecure. The reason I chose this website is because I like the modern and minimalistic approach they took. The home page is not too overwhelming, and the navigation is easy and smooth. This website also has a color scheme that is easy on the eyes and flows well with the design of the corporate logo.  My favorite piece from this site is the current event bar at the top that includes a link to learn more and allows you to close if unwanted. I hope to incorporate that into my own webpage by the end of this class.

		The second website that influenced me is YouTube. This might sound a little odd because of the difference in content, but YouTube is a perfect website in my opinion. The structure is minimalistic, easy to navigate, and allows the user to change the display settings from a white background or "light" setting to a darkened display of content. This kind of customization is not something that I would need for my type of website but is still impressive to me and something I will absolutely add to my skillset in the future. YouTube is also very responsive and smooth when opening and closing the navigation bar, which also updates with the subscriptions of the account holder. That is something I would like to incorporate into my website but instead of subscriptions I would like to have a shopping cart feed that allows you to remove and view items from any page.

		<!-- Three Goals -->

			<h2><em><u> Goals </u></em></h2>

		<hr>
		What I hope to achieve by developing this website is to create a sample to send into my future employers so they can see what I am capable of, as well as building a template for creating other websites. Aside from that I am affirming my future goals for after I finish my education at Dunwoody, and at the same time, improving my skillset for creating other online content. I want this website to be a model I can use for reference in the future and a testament to what I can accomplish with a few weeks of education and effort.
		<hr>






		<!-- Content Description -->

			<h2><em><u> Content </u></em></h2>

		<hr>
		The website I will create will have three separate pages. The first will be an "about" page. This will include a brief summary of what the company does, where it is based out of, the types of services provided, and a mission statement of values. The second page will be "products". This page will include pictures of various networking devices and services along with pricing and specific packages for different needs. The third page will be a support page that will have contact information for the support lines as well as mailto and phone linkage to make it easy to use.
		<hr>






		<!--Target Audience -->

				<h2><em><u> Target Audience </u></em></h2>

			<hr>
			The audience I am targeting is a little broad, but it pertains to mostly anyone who is seeking device or network protection. Whether that is a college student looking to get extra protection on their mobile device, a grandparent making sure their router is secure, or the everyday laptop user that needs a VPN service for when they are working from a coffee shop. Customers that come onto my site would be looking for small scale security software to protect their mobile devices and computer systems from malicious hackers.
